# Fun Calculator

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! ðŸŽ‰ This simple Python program lets you perform basic arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisionâ€”on two numbers you provide.

## Features

- Takes two numbers as input (including decimals)
- Computes and displays:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Quotient

## How to use

1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter the first number.
3. Enter the second number.
4. View the results for sum, difference, product, and quotient printed on the screen.

## Notes

- The program expects valid numeric input.
- Division by zero is not handled explicitly, so please avoid entering zero as the second number.

## Code Overview

The program uses `float()` to convert user inputs to decimal numbers, ensuring it works with both integers and decimal values. It then performs the four basic arithmetic calculations and prints the results with some fun commentary!
